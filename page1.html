        <h1>Hello...</h1>
        <p>
           Hi! My name is Sithmi Apsara, and I am currently a university student studying Department of Statistic and Computer Science in University of Kelaniya.  I love the way statistics allows us to make sense of complex data and uncover insights that can drive meaningful decisions. I’m fascinated by how statistical methods can be applied to a variety of fields, from healthcare to finance and social sciences, giving us tools to solve real-world problems. Through my studies, I’ve developed skills in data analysis, probability, and statistical modeling, and I’m excited to deepen my knowledge and make a positive impact through data. I am eager to apply my knowledge in meaningful ways. I enjoy tackling challenges, whether it’s through academic projects, internships, or exploring new ideas in my free time.In addition to my studies, I enjoy painting. I’m always open to connecting with others and learning something new!
