        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <ul class="achievements">
            <li> Development of Fundamental Theories
<p>Probability Theory: The establishment of probability theory by mathematicians like Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat laid the foundation for statistical analysis.</p></li>
            <li>Advances in Sampling and Survey Techniques
<p>Random Sampling: The implementation of random sampling methods allowed statisticians to make accurate inferences about large populations based on smaller samples, which transformed fields such as public health, political polling, and social sciences.
Design of Experiments: Fisherâ€™s work on experimental design introduced randomization and control groups, forming the foundation for scientific experiments and randomized controlled trials.<p></li>
